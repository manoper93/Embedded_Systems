1. **Motor Control**:
   - The motor's speed is adjusted in real-time using a potentiometer connected to the ADC of the ATmega128.
   - Feedback from the motor's encoder is processed to ensure accurate speed regulation.

2. **7-Segment Display**:
   - Displays the current motor speed and operational status.
   - The display is updated dynamically through multiplexing controlled by the microcontroller.

3. **Buttons**:
   - Allow the user to start, stop, and switch between operational modes.
